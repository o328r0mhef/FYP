Hardware Required:
    Nicla Vision
    PCA9546A multiplexer
    DRV2605L motor driver x3
    Seeed Studio haptic motor x3
    Tactile button (and pull-up resistor) connected to pin D0

Functionality:
    Operate a haptic electronic travel aid.
     Two main modes: 'distance warning' and 'object detection'
    'Distance warning' mode utilizes the VL53L1X Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor and the center motor to provide distance alerts.
    'Object detection' mode uses a trained FOMO MobileNet model from Edge Impulse to detect objects and trigger corresponding tactile responses.


Motor Library

Description:
This Python script contains a library for controlling the motors used in the main executable script. It provides functions for initialising motors, setting waveforms, and triggering motor actions.

Functionality:

    Provides functions for controlling the DRV2605L motor driver
    Includes functions for setting modes, waveforms, and operating PCA9546A multiplexer
